# debian-x64-arm32-emulation-setup
Debian x64 arm32 emulation enviroment setup script

run the file as root to install the test binary...
type `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib` or add to .bashrc to run more arm binaries via terminal binaries can be run as if they were on the native arch now.

probably works on any debian based distro as well... but I have nost tested it.
